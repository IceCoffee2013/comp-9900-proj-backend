The warehouse is huge with approximately\n50 aisles. The aisles are around\n80 metres long and divided at the halfway point by an aisle running at a right\nangle to all of the\nother aisles. This aisle is sometimes referred to as the\ncross aisle or breezeway.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"19\"\u003eThere\nare three types of vehicles in use at the warehouse.

The controls\nare in front of the operator. Behind the operator\nis a guard of approximately\ntwo metres in height. Behind the guard are two sets of tines extending back from\nthe driver. Each tine\nis 28 centimetres with a gap in the middle. These tines\nare long enough to carry two chep pallets, one behind the other. When the\npallet\nmover is moving, the operator stands at the front, facing forward, holding the\nsteering bar which includes the throttle. Beneath\nthe operator’s foot is a\nbutton. The pallet mover does not move unless the button is depressed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"21\"\u003eThere\nis racking on either side of the aisles with pallets loaded with boxes\ncontaining Coles’ products. The pallets are approximately\none metre by one\nmetre. (T44.31-32). The empty pallets are placed on the concrete floor. They are\nplaced within the racking so that\none edge of the pallet is horizontal and in\nline with the racking boundary on the aisle. Empty pallets at floor level are\nremoved\nby the forklift operators and replaced with loaded pallets. Traffic in\neach aisle is one way and alternates from aisle to aisle.\nThe rule is that the\ndrivers were to keep to the left unless they were overtaking a stationary\nmachine, similar to the everyday rules\nof an ordinary road.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"22\"\u003eAt\nany one time, there are many pallet movers travelling up and down the aisles.\nThe operators stop from time to time to pick up pallets\nfrom the floor level\npallets in the pick bays on either side of the aisle.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"23\"\u003eThe\npallet movers travel at speeds of 10 to 15 kilometres per hour. They are battery\npowered and move very quietly. At each cross\naisle pallet mover drivers are\ninstructed to sound their horn. Once an order is complete, the operator moves\nthe pallet mover to\nthe left hand side of the aisle and brings it to a halt. The\noperator lowers the tines so that the completed pallets remain on the\nfloor. The\noperator then gets down from the controls and wraps the completed order with\nplastic shrink wrap. The shrink wrap is wrapped\naround the load a number of\ntimes until it is securely covered. The roll of shrink wrap is carried on the\nplatform of the pallet\nmover behind the driver. Also behind the driver on the\npallet mover is a tray from which the driver has a pamphlet of stickers. The\nstickers comprise of an order and are removed and placed onto the boxes of\nproduct as they are picked up. The final stickers of every\norder contain the\nwords “end of order”.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"24\"\u003eThe\nplaintiff estimated that the aisles were three metres wide.

In cross examination, Mr Douglas agreed that the aisles\nwere roughly three metres\nwide. (T227.21-23). Therefore, I make a finding that\nthe aisles were roughly three metres wide.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e","\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"25\"\u003eThe\nplaintiff’s version of events is as follows. On 24 April 2009 at\napproximately 10:30 am, the plaintiff was working in the\nwarehouse in aisle CK.\nHe had completed picking an order of stock and had two fully laden pallets. One\npallet had already been wrapped\nin cling film and was sitting on the tines of\nthe pallet mover. The other pallet had been fully packed and was sitting on the\nfloor\nof the warehouse in the aisle where the plaintiff had packed it with boxes\nof soft drink. The pallet had been placed by the plaintiff\nin the aisle 50\ncentimetres away from the pallet racking on the right hand side, allowing enough\nspace for him to be able to walk\naround the pallet while another pallet mover\nproceeded past it. He was standing towards the centre of the aisle.\n(T52.23-25).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"26\"\u003eThe\naccident occurred while the plaintiff was in the process of wrapping the second\npallet in plastic wrap. The plaintiff’s\nevidence is that the plastic wrap\ncomes in long rolls and, in order to fully carry out the task of wrapping, one\nneeds to walk backwards\naround the pallet. As the plaintiff was wrapping the\npallet on the side closest to the centre of the aisle, he heard a big bang and\nfelt something strike him on his right hip. Almost simultaneously his right leg\nwas caught between the pallet he was wrapping and\na pallet on the forklift\nspeeding past him. The plaintiff was squashed between the loaded pallets,\ndragged along for a distance of\na few metres and then flung into the pallet\nracking.

The\npallet movers involved\nin the accident are pallet mover CN3582 and pallet mover\nCN3597. Exhibit D1/3 also shows the point of collision between the laden\nred and\nblue pallets. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was wrapping the laden\nred pallet with cling wrap to secure the\nload. During cross examination, Mr\nDouglas stated that the corner of the blue pallet was struck. (Ex D1/7,\nphotograph 3). The plaintiff\nmarked on the photograph Ex D1/3 the pallet he was\nwrapping with an almost heart shaped outline in black, incorrectly described as\nwhite in the transcript. (T51.16-17).

In\nresponse, Coles submitted that even if the relevant particulars of negligence\nrelied\nupon were made out, namely (g), (h) and (i), these were not a cause of\nthe injury to the plaintiff and are causally irrelevant to\nthe circumstances of\nthe plaintiff’s injury. These matters were not a necessary condition of\nthe occurrence of the harm to\nthe plaintiff. The system of work was safe had it\nbeen correctly followed by Mr Douglas. According to Coles, the plaintiff and Mr\nDouglas were properly instructed as to the operation of their pallet movers and\nwere both experienced operators. Mr Douglas does\nnot say the accident occurred\nbecause of his inability to operate the pallet mover. There is also no reason\nwhy two pallet movers\ncould not pass each other in the aisle.

This is because the pallet mover\nwas uninsured at\nthe time of the accident, was not owned by the Commonwealth or by any person or\nbody of persons representing the\nCommonwealth, and there is no right of action\nagainst the nominal defendant.

From this figure, his actual earnings must be deducted.\nThe evidence provided in respect of the plaintiff’s actual earnings was at\ntimes contradictory and unclear. However, relying\nupon the schedule of past\neconomic loss provided by the plaintiff, I calculate his actual yearly earnings\nas follows. I have no evidence\nas to any earnings between 1 January 2010 to 30\nJune 2010. From 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011, the plaintiff’s earnings were\n$106 per week, which at 52 weeks totals at $5,512. From 1 July 2011 to 30 June\n2012, he earned $735 per week with a total of $38,220\nfor that year. From 1 June\n2012 to 30 July 2013, he earned $322 per week resulting in yearly earnings of\n$16,744.

Nor\nhas any other evidence been tendered to this court in relation to\nearnings from these years. I therefore calculate the plaintiff’s\nactual\nearnings as $5512 + $38,220 + $16,744 + $4160 = $64,636.

The calculation is as follows: 118 weeks x 6\nhours = 708 hours. 708 hours x $25 = $17,770.\nThe plaintiff is therefore\nentitled to past attendant care in the sum of $17,770.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e","\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"263\"\u003eIn\nrespect of future attendant care, the plaintiff seeks 3 hours per week for life\n(42.67 years) at $40 per hour: 3 hours x 52 weeks\n= 156 hours. 156 hours x 42.67\n= 6,656.52 hours. 6,656.52 hours x $40 = $266,260.80.

The\nRECs contained terms that regulated how the Teams could retire from\nparticipation\nin the championship. One of those terms regulated the manner in\nwhich a Team could surrender its REC to V8 Holdings. V8 Holdings\nwas given\nauthority to attempt to sell the rights created by the REC by tender.

That is an agreement between V8\nHoldings,\nthe Teams and AMRP (the last-mentioned party representing the\ninterests of Archer). In effect, the Special Majority is an ordinary\nmajority of\nthe board of directors provided that the majority includes one director\nappointed by AMRP and one director appointed\nby the Teams.

The\nfirst proceeded on\nthe basis that the wording “ensure that the price paid\nfor the Rights is as commercially advantageous as possible having regard\nto the\ncurrent market situation” imposed upon V8 Holdings an obligation\ntantamount to a guarantee that the price ultimately\nachieved would in fact be as\ncommercially advantageous as possible having regard to the current market\nsituation.

(In putting these two possibilities, as V8\nHoldings did in its submissions, I have not ignored V8\nHoldings’ argument\nthat, as a matter of strict logic, the first proposition could not stand alone\ndivorced from the practical\nneed to determine the most commercially advantageous\nprice as a result of the tender process).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"51\"\u003eUltimately,\nas I understand Sanpoint’s final written submissions, V8 Holdings’\napprehension that Sanpoint contended that\ncl 10.1(b) had the absolute effect of\nthe first of the alternatives set out above was misplaced, as in the\nintroduction Sanpoint\nput its case in the following way:\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e","\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"52\"\u003eThat\nsubmission is consistent with the second of the alternatives stated by V8\nHoldings.

Sanpoint accepted that the inter-relationship\nbetween that obligation and the part of the provision which said “by\noffering the contract to the market by tender” was at the heart of the\ncase (par 6).

The list of shortcomings in the tender process in the declaration\nin prayer 2 of the claim for relief is consistent\nwith the obligation to ensure\nonly relating to the manner in which the tender was implemented. The same is\ntrue for Sanpoint’s\nallegation of breach of cl 10.1(b) in par 23 of the\ncross claim, save for the addition of sub-par 23(h), which I will consider\nseparately\nbelow.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"57\"\u003eThe\nparties are in dispute as to what the use of the words “current market\nsituation” in cl 10.1(b) concurrently with\nthe requirement that V8\nHoldings was to “ensure” a specified result of the tender process\nrequired V8 Holdings to do\nin relation to the information that was provided to\nbidders. Without elaboration on their part, the parties appear to have accepted\nthat the use of the expression “current market situation” directed\nattention to the economic reality that the fixing\nof prices by markets depends\nupon the information that is available to competing bidders. If the agent of the\nseller has an obligation\nto ensure that the price offered by the highest bidder\nin the tender process is as advantageous to the seller as possible, the agent\nmust disclose to competing bidders the information material to an assessment by\nthe bidders of the value of the rights on offer that\nwill induce the bidders to\noffer the highest prices possible.

It was Sanpoint’s case\nthat the obligation upon V8 Holdings to ensure the achievement of\nthe most\ncommercially advantageous price possible through the tender process required V8\nHoldings in substance to provide all of\nthe evolving information to bidders, and\nto do so on a continuing basis. Sanpoint went so far as to submit that, if it\nbecame practically\ndifficult for V8 Holdings to paraphrase the available\ninformation, as that information was substantially embodied in emails that\nwere\nexchanged between relevant persons, V8 Holdings could have, and should have,\nsimply made all of the emails available to potential\nbidders.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"59\"\u003eThe\npractical effect of the obligation to “ensure” was to require V8\nHoldings to act in Sanpoint’s interests, rather\nthan its own, or the\ninterests of Archer or the remaining Teams. It is also implicit in\nSanpoint’s case that the obligation\non V8 Holdings to “ensure”\nthat bidders had all of the information that was likely to induce them to offer\nthe most advantageous\nprice obliged V8 Holdings to make that information\navailable in a manner that was not circumscribed by any self-interested\nobjective\nof V8 Holdings to minimise any litigation risk to itself at the suit\nof bidders by reason of possibly misleading overstatements as\nto the underlying\nvalue of the REC.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"60\"\u003eIn\nessence, although Sanpoint did not expound the argument, Sanpoint contended that\nthe obligation upon V8 Holdings in cl 10.1(b)\nto ensure a particular result by\nthe manner in which it conducted the tender “having regard to the current\nmarket situation”\nhad to recognise that the word “current”\napplied to the whole of the period of the tender leading up to its close, so\nthat if the available information evolved in a way that was likely to encourage\ncompeting bidders to offer higher prices, then V8\nHoldings was required to\nprogressively provide that information to bidders. Furthermore, the obligation\nto “ensure” that\nthe highest bid would be as advantageous as\npossible given the evolving information required V8 Holdings to provide the\ninformation\nfully and not to restrict the information in any way in order to\nachieve the interests of itself or any other parties than Sanpoint.\nSanpoint did\nnot, of course, go so far as to submit that the REC required V8 Holdings to\nconduct the tender in a manner that was\nmisleading and deceptive, or was likely\nto mislead and deceive bidders, or was in any other manner unlawful. However, it\ndid submit\nthat the obligation to “ensure” required V8 Holdings to\ngo to the fullest extent that fell short of a real risk of unlawful\nbehaviour.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"61\"\u003eAs\nwill be seen, V8 Holdings’ position was that the obligation imposed upon\nit by cl 10.1(b) was much more static and constrained.\nV8 Holdings considered\nthat it was sufficient for it to make a single notification of the possibility\nof an event occurring that\nwould tend to increase the price that competing\nbidders might offer for the REC, and to do so in a neutrally worded and\nconventional\nmanner that would minimise the risk of misleading or deceiving\nbidders.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"62\"\u003eIt\nwill be convenient to defer further consideration of the position adopted by V8\nHoldings, and the resolution of the contest between\nthe parties, until after the\nrelevant facts have been determined.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"63\"\u003eAs\nI have observed, at the end of the tender process no bids had been made for\nSanpoint’s REC.

Although that\nruling was based upon the proper construction of the term, and may not exclude a\ncase that a new tender\nwas required because of the events that happened, I do\nnot understand Sanpoint to have attempted to make out a separate case that\na new\ntender was required.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"84\"\u003eI\ndo not understand Sanpoint to have formally abandoned its claim in par 23(h).\nHowever, Sanpoint did not support this aspect of its\npleaded claim in its final\nsubmissions. This claim would depend upon cl 10.1(b) of the REC being given the\nmore absolute of the two\npossible constructions formulated by V8 Holdings that I\nhave set out above. V8 Holdings could only be in breach of cl 10.1 of the\nREC by\nselling the Rights for an amount less than the market value of the Rights if on\nits proper construction the provision required\nV8 Holdings to ensure that the\nmost commercially advantageous price possible was obtained, which is at least\narguably equivalent\nto obtaining the market value of the Rights.

I will proceed on the basis that as a practical\nmatter, Sanpoint has also abandoned this aspect\nof its claim. In any event, par\n23(h) depends upon a construction of cl 10.1(b) of the REC that is incorrect, as\nit ignores the requirement\nthat V8 Holdings is required to ensure that the price\nis as commercially advantageous as possible by offering the Contract to the\nmarket by tender.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"85\"\u003eFurthermore,\nthe claim for damages that Sanpoint finally made was a claim based upon the\nvalue of the chance that it lost that its\nREC would have been sold for a higher\nprice than $20,000 if the alleged breach by V8 Holdings of cl 10.1 of the REC\nhad not occurred,\nrather than damages equal to the difference between the value\nof the REC and the amount received.

This statement appears to reflect some preliminary indication made by\nArcher, which is not otherwise\nestablished by the evidence, that any restructure\nshould be on the basis that there were 26 cars in the field. There is some\nevidence\nthat 26 cars was the minimum that V8 Holdings’ agreement with\nbroadcasters required. It is not clear whether the 26 car number\nwas selected\nafter Archer became aware that three RECs had been surrendered. It is not clear\nwhether Archer was wedded to the number\n26, and not more. Mr Dane commented:\n“It is up to the Board to decide whether to match any tender offers and\nbuy back. So the\nBoard can make this determination in due course”.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"160\"\u003eMr\nHogarth said: “Given the illiquidity of any REC market, is 21 days the\nright period of time for the tender?” Mr Dane’s\nresponse was:\n“Anyone who is potentially in the market will know about the availability\nand will be able to act in my opinion.\nThis will flush people out”. This\nevidence establishes that V8 Holdings was aware that the market for RECs was\nilliquid. Mr\nHogarth at least was aware that a 21 day period may not maximise\nthe chances of one or more of the RECs being sold. Mr Dane repeated\nhis\nassertion that potential purchasers would be able to act quickly. Even though\nthere is some probability that potential purchasers\nwould be well acquainted\nwith V8 Supercars racing, it does not follow that they could put together an\neffective racing business model\nin 21 days. Mr Dane had already indicated his\npreference for the interests of the business and the remaining Teams.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"161\"\u003eMr\nHogarth suggested alternatives to running a tender, in view of the probability\nthat “there will likely be a large process\nof winding up the current REC\nformat and the constitutions and shareholder agreements for V8HPL”. V8\nHoldings could negotiate\na buyback price with the three surrendering RECs.\nCurrent REC holders and Archer could agree on a price “as part of the\nbroader\nrestructure resolutions”. V8 Holdings could buy back the\nsurrendered RECs and account to the surrendering REC holders for the\nnet\nproceeds.

It\nadded that there was an extraordinary lack of information about the\npotential\ncorporate restructure that was put in the tender documents. It submitted that\nclause 10 of the RECs required V8 Holdings\n“to put in place a tender\nprocess that is best placed to achieve the central tenet of clause 10 which is\nto get the best price.\nYet, Mr Hogarth has obviously been instructed that option\none is to conduct the tender process in advance of any corporate\nrestructure”\n(T 24.5).

He said: “V8 Holdings\ncan exercise its\n“absolute discretion” to rank the bidders in order of descending\nprice, rank the surrendered RECs in\norder of longest tenure to shortest tenure\nin the sport, and transfer the surrendered RECs accordingly”. As it\nhappened, there\nwere no compliant third-party bids for Sanpoint’s REC, or\neither of the other two surrendered RECs. The board of V8 Holdings\nwas not\nrequired to deal with the problem of bidders offering different prices, or there\nbeing fewer bidders than RECs on sale. However,\nit is significant that from this\npoint V8 Holdings gave consideration to how it would deal with these problems.\nThat is a matter\nthat may be relevant to the determination of whether Sanpoint\nhas demonstrated that it suffered a loss as a result of any breach\nof the REC by\nV8 Holdings, and if so, the quantification of that loss. It would be necessary\nto consider what benefit Sanpoint would\nhave enjoyed if the tender process had\nbeen conducted differently, and one or more compliant bids had been received at\nperhaps different\ntender amounts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"173\"\u003eThere\nis some basis for inferring that by 27 May 2014 Archer had made a proposal that\nwould have guaranteed payments to each Team\nof $400,000 gross for the coming\nseasons, compared with the amount of $208,116 estimated gross for the 2014\nseason.

Mr\nWarburton’s email seems to reflect the then current state of negotiations\nbetween V8 Holdings\nand Archer. $600,000 of value per Team is said to be worth\n$45 million of EBIT. Sanpoint submitted that this figure should be compared\nwith\nwhat the bidders were eventually given in the data room, which was the 2013\nfigure of EBIT of $20 million, which equated to\na net payment to each Team of\n$37,000 after payment out of the gross share of EBIT of the costs that were\nrequired to be borne by\nthe Teams.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"179\"\u003eIt\nmay be observed that, although the current state of negotiations may have been\nmuch more attractive to potential bidders than the\nhistorical situation, the\nfirst six bullet points in the email would have been challenging to potential\nbidders. A possible future\nreceipt of $500,000-$600,000 gross per year, if a\nrestructure was implemented, would have to be judged against the fact that Teams\nwere burning about $1 million in losses per car, and that Ford was pulling out,\nas well as the fact that 10% of the RECs had been\nsurrendered, and seven were at\nrisk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"180\"\u003eOn\n29 May 2014, Mr Hogarth advised Amanda Evans at Ernst \u0026amp; Young: “As you\nknow, we are keen to conduct the required tender\nas soon as possible, and I am\nreceiving increasing pressure from the board to start the process”.

The effect\nof Sanpoint’s submission is that cl 10.1(b)\nimposed a continuing obligation on V8 Holdings to provide all of the evolving\ninformation\nto potential bidders through the tender process.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"302\"\u003eAs\nI understand it, V8 Holdings did not make any specific submissions directed at\nthe meaning of the word “current” in\nthe provision.

Of course, as no conforming bids were made,\nthese mathematical\nconsiderations remain theoretical.

It is situated some 50 kilometres from Eden\nand 20 kilometres from Toowoomba, but is in the\nsame district as the\ndeceased’s property, Pericoe Farm. Pericoe is indeed a very small rural\ncommunity. It is located in the\nTowamba State Forest in the Bega Valley shire on\nthe south-coast of New South Wales. Pericoe is approximately a one hour drive\nwest\nfrom Eden.

Ms\nWilson says they did not end up living together because the deceased needed\nto\nattend to proper animal husbandry practices on Pericoe Farm. She says that at\none stage they all tried to live at the deceased’s\nhouse but it ended up\nbeing too small for all of them, so she moved back to Rosebank and he mostly\nlived at Pericoe Farm, so he could\nbe directly accessible to look after the\nneeds of his cattle.

Some\nof the happiest of these photographs involved the deceased with Ms\nWilson’s\nchildren.

He was something of a collector of\nantique bikes. Not all of his bikes were operational\nbut they were rare and\nunless properly secured were liable to theft. The deceased was well-known in the\nlocal community to work long\nhours and sometimes do shift work at the Eden chip\nmill. Leaving the bikes at his home may have been an invitation to thieves.

He had a 1929 Harley Davidson J model. This was a\nrare bike from the final year of production of\nHarley-Davidson models prior to\nthe decline in Harley-Davidson sales due to the Great Depression. The next was a\n1926 Indian Scout\nmotorcycle, one early type of this model of motorcycle\nproduced in the United States by the Indian motorcycle company between 1920\nand\n1949. Finally, he had at 1944 Indian Chief, some varieties of which were\noriginally produced during the Second World War but\nthen widely sold for\ncivilian applications. Ms Wilson says, and I accept, that this vehicle may have\nbeen worth up to $35,000. The\ndeceased leaving them with her even after the time\nin about 2009, when their de facto relationship ended is explained as the simple\nexpedient of like-minded friends and neighbours seeking to secure property from\nthieves.

He had\nbeen mulling over Mrs Drysdale’s good advice for some\ntime and he finally made a decision. Ms Wilson is prone to violent outbursts.\nShe has a heavy habitual intake of alcohol. In my view she is not at times\ncapable of controlling herself. It is likely in my view\nthat one of these\nincidents got out of hand in about 2009 or 2010 and she severely assaulted the\ndeceased, who realised that a continued\nrelationship between himself and Ms\nWilson was impossible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"82\"\u003eMr\nJones went further, later.

He\nrecalls, and I accept, that\nby October 2013 from what he observed and had been\ntold, that he had doubts about the continuity of the deceased’s\nrelationship\nwith Ms Wilson.

None\nof Ms Wilson’s other friends were in a\nposition to do this for her. The deceased probably did so. To this extent I do\naccept\nthe evidence of Ms Wilson and the witnesses called in her case: that the\ngathering of the Chip Mill that night was preliminary to\norganising her 50th\nbirthday party. The deceased was probably a moving force in arranging this\nevent.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"92\"\u003eBut\nhis friendship to her was always clouded by caution because of her unpredictable\nbehaviour under the influence of alcohol.

Each\nparagraph is a separate description of a risk covered by the policy. Far from\ntreating the separate paragraphs as forming a genus,\nit is more likely that the\nTPD definition has evolved over a period of time by the accretion of essentially\ndifferent risks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"86\"\u003eThe\nresult is that each paragraph should be construed according to its own terms by\napplying the received principles of contractual\nconstruction.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"87\"\u003eFurthermore,\nin my view the submission should be rejected because it is essentially\nmeaningless and impossible of application. One\nof the difficulties that arise in\ndealing with psychological injury in the first place is that the injury though\nuniversally accepted\nto be real has a largely subjective manifestation. From the\nperspective of the court there are no effective objective measures of\nthe true\neffect and seriousness of the psychological injury (which is why the court is\nparticularly reliant upon expert medical testimony\nand lay evidence of the\noutward manifestations of the injury). Consequently, the court cannot accurately\nassess the seriousness of\na particular psychological injury for the purpose of\nmaking a judgment as to whether the injury is “most serious” in\ncomparison to the consequences of the physical injuries described in the other\nparagraphs of the TPD definition. Put shortly, it\nis nonsense for the court to\nattempt to distinguish the seriousness of the psychological injury suffered by a\nperson with PTSD and\nmajor depression as being more or less serious than the\ninjury suffered by a person who has lost the use of one limb and the sight\nof\none eye. The submission implies that persons who suffer from the serious\npsychological effects of PTSD and major depression are\nless seriously injured\nthan a person who has lost one limb and the sight of one eye, for example,\nbecause the person in fact is physically\nuninjured. There is no basis for this\nimplication either as a matter of scientific foundation or ordinary\nexperience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"88\"\u003eThe\nfact that MetLife put the submission is in my view a serious cause for concern.\nIt is not customary in cases of this kind for\nthe insurer to go into evidence\nand call the claims managers responsible for the rejection of the claim for a\nTPD benefit. The claimant\nand the court are left to divine the insurer’s\ndecision-making process from any procedural fairness letter that has been issued\nby the insurer and the letter that explains the reasons for the rejection. Those\nletters generally do not disclose the precise meaning\nattributed by the insurer\nto the relevant TPD definition. The definition is usually set out at the\nbeginning of the rejection letter,\nand the claimant and the court are left to\nassume that the insurer has adopted a correct construction of the meaning of the\ndefinition\nin determining whether it should be satisfied that the definition\napplies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"89\"\u003eThe\nvice of the construction of the TPD definition urged on the court by MetLife in\nthis case is that it proposes a gloss to the meaning\nof the words of par (b).\nThat is, it suggests that the first step in applying that definition is to\ndetermine whether the words apply\nto the particular case, and the second step is\nthen to make a judgment as to whether in the case of a psychological injury, the\nseriousness\nof the consequences to the claimant are such as to put the injury in\nthe same class of seriousness as the physical injuries described\nin the other\nparagraphs of the definition.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"90\"\u003eThe\nvery making of this submission by MetLife immediately suggested to the court\nthat MetLife may in fact have acted on the basis\nthat par (b) of the TPD\ndefinition should be construed in the manner submitted by MetLife.

If that is the true\ndescription of the right, if the condition is not satisfied the right does not\nexist. It may\nnot be unreasonable to construe the insuring clause as having the\neffect (a) of giving the claimant a right to a benefit if the required\nconsequences of the incapacity are established, but (b) granting the insurer the\nright to decide based upon its own satisfaction\nwhether the consequences exist,\nand (c) making the entitlement to the benefit conditional upon the insurer being\nso satisfied. If\nthe insuring clause were construed in that way, and the\ninsurer’s breach of duty disabled it from insisting upon the condition\nin\n(b) and (c), the claimant’s right in (a) could be determined by the court\nwithout any apparent rewriting of the contract.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"140\"\u003eIf\none takes the insuring clause in the present case in the Blue Ribbon policy as\nan example, cl 3 provided: “If an Insured\nMember ... suffers from TPD\nwhile this policy is in force ... we will pay to the policy owner the Sum\nInsured in respect of that\nmember...” At least in form, this is a promise\nto pay the benefit if the claimant suffers from TPD. In the case of the physical\ninjuries referred to in pars (a) and (c) of the TPD definition, the benefits\nwill be payable if the physical consequences described\nin the paragraphs occur.\nThe position is different in the case of par (b) and made complicated by the\nfact that the words “and\nhaving provided proof to our satisfaction\nthat...” have been inserted into the middle of the description of the\ncircumstances\nthat are intended to entitle the claimant to the benefit.

The\nsolution adopted by the substantial body of appellate decisions is a sensible\nway to deal with the need to resolve such disputes\nin a way which is fair to the\ninsured and insurer”.

If in fact\nthere was some breach of duty by the insurer, it will involve a breach of the\ncontract\nof insurance. However, the objective of the insured is to gain the\nbenefit. The insured does not usually pursue a claim for damages\nfor breach of\ncontract by the insurer, which would probably take the form of a claim for\ndamages for a lost opportunity that if the\ninsurer had made the determination\nproperly it would have been satisfied that the TPD benefit was payable (see\nBasten JA in \u003ci\u003eBirdsall\u003c/i\u003e (above) at [25]).

According to the relevant determination,\na person was\npermanently incapacitated if “the person is permanently\nunable to do work for [certain] periods” (see [10]). The relevant\ncriterion was a permanent inability to do work. In \u003ci\u003eWells v Australian\nAviation Underwriting Pool\u003c/i\u003e, the TPD definition included “is beyond\nhope of improvement and which would prevent the Insured Person engaging in each\nand\nevery occupation or employment for wage or profit for which he or she is\nreasonably qualified by training, education or experience”:\n(see [4]).\nAgain, the focus of the wording is on actual incapacity. Finally, in \u003ci\u003eHannover\nLife Re of Australasia Ltd v Colella\u003c/i\u003e, the TPD definition required:\n“they continue to be so disabled that he or she is in our opinion unable\nto resume their previous\noccupation at any time in the future and will be unable\nat any time in the future to perform any Other Occupation” (as defined)\n(see [14]).

In this case it is necessary (a) that\nthe claimant has become incapacitated; but it is also necessary\n(b) that the\nclaimant is unlikely ever to gain relevant employment. The second requirement\ngoes further than objective incapacity\nto undertake employment.

However, it may be wise to bear in mind\nthat\npractical problems may arise in applying the TPD definition, if the focus\nis on ‘bare’ physical and mental incapacity,\nrather than the\npractical effect of the relationship between the incapacity and the likelihood\nthat the claimant will ever gain relevant\nemployment. It may be necessary to\ntake into account the effect of medication. Medication may cure the incapacity,\nor if it does\nnot cure it, it may create a situation where the claimant becomes\ncapable of acting with reasonable normality notwithstanding the\ncontinuing\nunderlying incapacity. In other cases, the medication may have continuing\neffects that leave the claimant on the borderline\nbetween capacity and\nincapacity, such as where the claimant must be tranquillised to blunt the effect\nof the incapacity. In still\nother cases, the medication may make the claimant\nobjectively capable, but an obligation to disclose to prospective employers the\nneed for medication may inhibit the real likelihood of employment. In the\npresent case MetLife says that Ms Hellessey is capable\nof gaining employment as\na driving instructor or a child care worker, but one may wonder what the effect\nwould be of Ms Hellessey\ndisclosing that she needed to take Valium to avoid\nanxiety or panic attacks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e","\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"168\"\u003eOn\n12 April 2014, MetLife wrote its first procedural fairness letter to Ms\nHellessey.

The difference may\nbe thought to be\nsubtle, but the word “inconsistent” has a different connotation to\n“inconsistencies”. The\nformer is more absolute. Dr Hodgson used the\nword “inconsistencies” as a precursor to expressing her opinion that\nshe\nwas “unable to give a professional independent medical opinion as [she\nwas] doubtful whether or not credence can be given to\nFacebook comments and\nphotos”.

The extremity of MetLife’s position is demonstrated by\nits failure to list Dr Durrell’s reports in the first\nrejection (par 253\nabove) and its failure to summarise their contents notwithstanding the summaries\nmade of other medical opinions\n(par 303 above). In my view this was of itself an\nunreasonable course for MetLife to have taken because of the obvious importance\nof this evidence to Ms Hellessey’s claim.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"315\"\u003eMetLife’s\nresponse to Dr Durrell’s reports should not, however, be viewed in\nisolation. MetLife justified its treatment\nof Dr Durrell’s reports by\ndescribing his view as being a minority one (par 306 above). It also gave\nexcessive weight to the\nearly medical opinions expressed around the time of the\nassessment date (par 175 above). Although MetLife gave some weight to Dr\nHodgson’s reports, in my view it did not give proper weight to all of the\nmedical reports that it received before the time\nof the third rejection,\ncontrary to the principle established in \u003ci\u003eTAL v Shuetrim\u003c/i\u003e (par 130 above).\nThis course on MetLife’s part had the subsidiary effect that MetLife gave\nundue weight to initial expressions\nof medical opinion such as Mr Ward’s\nstatement that he would “like to remain optimistic” (pars 210 and\n218 above);\nDr Hodgson’s statement that Ms Hellessey “may with\ntime” be capable of employment (par 229 above); and Dr Bertucen’s\nstatement that Ms Hellessey “may be capable” of employment (par\n237/238 above). There is some force in Ms Hellessey’s\ncriticism of\nMetLife’s reasoning that these expressions by the doctors when looked at\nclosely were really statements of hope\nrather than considered medical opinions.\nHowever, in my view, the greater vice was that MetLife’s reasoning led it\nto completely\ndiscount Dr Durrell’s considered opinions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"316\"\u003eIn\nthis regard, I have not ignored the fact that in Dr Hodgson’s second\nreport she expressed a definite view that Ms Hellessey\ndid not satisfy the TPD\ndefinition, even though she had not seen Ms Hellessey again, and had not clearly\nexpressed that opinion in\nher first report after she had examined Ms Hellessey.\nHowever, it was in my view unreasonable for MetLife to treat Dr Hodgson’s\nopinion as being of greater value than Dr Durrell’s many statements of\nopinion, given that Dr Hodgson made no attempt to respond\nto Dr Durrell’s\nreasoning, and indeed gave no real reasons for her own opinion. Furthermore, Dr\nHodgson pointedly advised MetLife\nthat she should be given the opportunity to\nexamine Ms Hellessey again (par 279 above), and that advice was ignored by\nMetLife.

While there was considerable evidence that Ms Hellessey did not lead the\nlife of a hermit, the\nevidence from the surveillance report and the Facebook\nposts did not justify the conclusion reached by MetLife, as a matter of its\nown\njudgment, because MetLife ignored the opinions of the medical experts in the\nmanner that I have described above (pars 194, 197,\n198, 202, 205, 217, 227, 228,\n231-233 above). All medical opinion was to the effect that Ms Hellessey was\ntotally incapacitated from\nany employment up to the date of MetLife’s\nthird rejection. The question was whether Ms Hellessey was unlikely ever in the\nfuture to have the capacity to engage in relevant employment. I am not satisfied\nthat a valid opinion on that subject could be expressed\nby a layperson in the\nposition of MetLife. It could not reasonably be expressed in the face of\ncontrary opinion by the relevant medical\nexperts.

They were conclusions that\nwere directly inconsistent with the unanimous views expressed by the medical\nexperts concerning\nMs Hellessey’s present incapacity (except possibly for\nthe observation by Dr Hodgson in her second report that there may be\n“inconsistencies” that warranted re-examination of Ms\nHellessey).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"321\"\u003eThirdly,\nthe conclusion expressed by MetLife in (3) that Ms Hellessey’s activities\nwere “contrary to that reported to\nthe treating doctors” was simply\nfalse. MetLife ignored the responses given by Mr Ward and Dr Durrell to MetLife\nin reports\nthat were directly responsive to enquiries on this subject (pars 194,\n197, 198 202, 205, 217 and 219 above), Dr Durrell and Mr Ward\nexplained in their\nreports in some detail their responses to Ms Hellessey’s Facebook posts\nand her involvement in horse-related\nactivities. They advocated these activities\nas being therapeutic. They made no suggestion that these activities were\ninconsistent\nwith their diagnoses or their views as to Ms Hellessey’s\nprognosis. The detail of the evidence of Ms Hellessey’s activities\ndid not\njustify the conclusion that Ms Hellessey had misled her treating medical\nprofessionals, given that those professionals were\nclearly aware of the\nsubstance of the evidence.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"322\"\u003eThis\nis a significant finding, because in the absence of any explanation from\nMetLife, it justifies a conclusion that MetLife had\nacted upon a false belief,\nwhich it had formed internally on the basis of its own understanding of the\nFacebook posts and the surveillance\nreport, contrary to the weight of the\navailable evidence, that Ms Hellessey had made a false claim based upon her\ncurrent circumstances.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"323\"\u003eAs\nexpressed, MetLife’s conclusion was not one that accepted the medical view\nthat Ms Hellessey was currently totally incapacitated,\nbut put forward a\nconclusion that Ms Hellessey was likely to be able to find relevant employment\nin the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"324\"\u003eOf\nparticular significance is the failure by MetLife to respond to what was\neffectively the final word expressed by Dr Durrell in\nhis 29 September 2013\nreport, where he referred to the need of Ms Hellessey for medications including\nZoloft, Cipramil, Valium and\nXanax in order for her to continue with her horse\nrelated activities, and that: “In terms of her Zoloft medication over\nrecent\nweeks I have identified that Ms Hellessey, despite a dose of 250 mg\ndaily, was having breakthrough anxiety and developed tolerance\nto this\nmedication.

If too\nearly a determination is made as to whether a particular claimant satisfies the\nTPD definition then the claimant’s claim is\nlikely to be rejected on a\nstatistical basis.

MetLife’s first\nprocedural fairness letter was dated 17 April\n2014, almost 6 months after the date of Dr Durrell’s report. Ms\nHellessey’s\nsolicitors did not respond until their letter to the Trustee\non 9 July 2014.

Consistently\nwith what I said in \u003ci\u003eWheeler\u003c/i\u003e, it was not unreasonable\nfor MetLife to accept the advice given by Mr Ward. If the decision was made\nafter the receipt of Dr Durrell’s\nreport, that would lead to the deferral\nof the decision until in or about February 2014. (There are grounds for doubt\nthat MetLife\nactually acted on Mr Ward’s advice. MetLife did not cause Ms\nHellessey to be re-examined by any medical expert in or after\nFebruary 2014.\nFurther, the terms of its first and second procedural fairness letters clearly\ndemonstrate that the suggestion that\nMetLife would rely upon a later medical\nreport was inconsistent with its view that only reports that were\ncontemporaneous with the\nassessment date were probative).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"779\"\u003eAn\nimportant factor weighing against a finding of constructive rejection is that,\ngiven the length of time that did elapse, neither\nMs Hellessey nor the Trustee\ncommunicated to MetLife a warning that if it did not make a determination within\na reasonable, specified\ntime, MetLife’s failure to act would be treated as\na constructive rejection. Where a significant period of time has elapsed\nwith\nthe insurer taking various steps from time to time to put itself in a position\nto make its determination, it may be difficult\nfor a trustee or a claimant to\nestablish constructive rejection if they have not, so to speak, made time of the\nessence by giving\nan appropriate notice to the insurer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"780\"\u003eIn\nall of these circumstances, I am not satisfied that any delay in making the\ndetermination in the first rejection involved so serious\na breach of\nMetLife’s duty as to constitute a constructive rejection of Ms\nHellessey’s claim.

On 27 June 2016, MetLife was provided a further report of Dr Westmore\ndated 20 June\n2016, which addressed some of the concerns in MetLife’s\nthird procedural fairness letter.

Ms Hellessey\nthrough her solicitors continually\nprovided additional evidence to MetLife in\ncircumstances that invited MetLife to consider and respond to that evidence. Ms\nHellessey\ndid not insist upon compliance with any of the deadlines that she\nsought unilaterally to impose upon MetLife.

This is necessary\nbecause it is clear from the\ncontents and brevity of the third rejection letter that it was intended to be an\naddendum to the third\nand fourth procedural fairness letters. Second, I address\nthe reasonableness of MetLife’s treatment of the evidence.

For this reason, I will consider the third rejection\nletter first,\nthe fourth procedural fairness letter second, and the third\nprocedural fairness letter third. However, before turning to each of\nthese\nletters, I will briefly recapitulate the process that led to MetLife's third\nrejection of Ms Hellessey's claim.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e","\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"829\"\u003eAfter\nMetLife had rejected Ms Hellessey’s application on two occasions, and\ntwice agreed to review its decision, Ms Hellessey\npursued her application by\nproviding additional medical reports to MetLife.

Secondly, it indicated that it had given Mr Rawling’s\nsupplementary report dated 21 November 2016 little weight because the\ninstructions given to him did not draw his attention to the\ninformation\nconcerning Ms Hellessey’s Facebook posts, or records from the Palomino\nAssociation or various pony clubs, or her\ninvolvement with Fairymead.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"833\"\u003eApart\nfrom these two new issues, MetLife’s third rejection letter did not\ncontain any substantial reasons as to why it had rejected\nMs Hellessey’s\nclaim.

MetLife rejected the submission that Mr\nEverett had not taken into account Ms Hellessey’s psychological\ndisorder.\nIt also rejected Dr Westmore’s opinion that the vocational assessment\nreport was unreliable because the opinion was\n“flawed” as Dr\nWestmore “was not provided with a full or accurate history”.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"844\"\u003eFinally,\nMetLife dealt with further medical evidence provided on behalf of Ms Hellessey\n(pages 17 and 18).

Mr Ward’s notes were consistent with Ms Hellessey having the serious\nsymptoms she claims to have. Ms Hellessey made significant disclosures to Mr\nWard of her horse-related activities, contrary to MetLife’s\nconclusion\nthat Ms Hellessey had suppressed this type of information from her treating\nmedical professionals.

Accordingly, it would be unreasonable\nfor MetLife to evaluate the Facebook posts in the same way as if\nthey had been\nmade by a person of ordinary psychological health. The posts were made by a\nperson who the weight of medical opinion\nestablished was sufficiently\npsychologically injured to be unable to work at the present. Reasonable\ndecision-making on MetLife’s\npart would require it to be sensitive to the\ndangers of judging the significance of statements made in an artificial context\nby a\npsychologically injured person by applying the norms that would be true for\npsychologically healthy people.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"969\"\u003eIn\nthis case MetLife had been given specific advice by Dr Durrell that\n“contacts on Facebook do not represent real life friendships”\n(par\n194 above), and Dr Hodgson said “Ms Hellessey may appear happy in her\nFacebook postings, but I am unable to give a professional\nindependent opinion as\nI am doubtful whether or not credence can be given to Facebook comments and\nphotos.

Professor Mattick formed the view that her\nscores established\nclear evidence that Ms Hellessey was exaggerating her\nemotional disturbance. He concluded that the scores did not suggest that Ms\nHellessey did not have some emotional problems, but she was exaggerating the\nextent of them.

It appears that the level of exaggeration identified by\nMr Rawling was less\nthan that found by Professor Mattick. Mr Rawling reached a\ndifferent conclusion than Professor Mattick, being that expressed at par\n699\nabove: “There was certainly no evidence of factitious failure on cognitive\ntesting. On personality testing, she showed\nthe tendency, common among people\nwith psychological disorders, to see their symptoms as extreme, but there was\nagain no compelling\nevidence of exaggerated claims of disability”.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"995\"\u003eIt\nis necessary to evaluate the significance of this relatively isolated evidence,\ncoming into existence in mid-2016, in the context\nof the whole of the evidence\nconcerning the effects of Ms Hellessey’s psychological injury since the\nassessment date.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"996\"\u003eI\naccept that the findings of Professor Mattick and Mr Rawling were real and\ncorrectly reported. However, I have also accepted the\nlay evidence of Ms\nHellessey’s witnesses concerning her day-to-day behaviour and the\nlimitations on her activities. It must\nbe recalled that Dr Hodgson accepted that\nMs Hellessey appeared a genuine and sincere historian and did not believe that\nsecondary\ngain was playing a role in Ms Hellessey’s current presentation,\nas at 20 September 2012 (par 227 above). Dr Durrell and Mr\nWard examined Ms\nHellessey on many occasions over a period of years, and were satisfied that she\nhad the symptoms that they identified\nin their various reports. It is\nsignificant that Ms Hellessey performed the psychiatric tests about five years\nafter the assessment\ndate. As early as Dr Durrell’\u003ca href=\"/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wca1987255/s16.html\" class=\"autolink_findacts\"\u003es 16\u003c/a\u003e February 2013\nreport (par 189 above), Dr Durrell had reported that ongoing uncertainty\nconcerning her claim was itself a source of\nconsiderable anxiety and that Ms\nHellessey had limited coping mechanisms due to her PTSD.

Speaking\nneutrally, it is not surprising that Ms Hellessey\ndeveloped a strong antipathy\ntowards MetLife.

When Ms Hellessey undertook the psychometric tests, her responses were\nprobably influenced\nby anger at having to undertake further tests (her\napplication for the benefits having already been rejected twice) and probably\nalso a tendency reported by Mr Rawling for persons with significant\npsychological disturbance to overstate the seriousness of their\ncondition in the\nway they articulate their feelings in a test situation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"998\"\u003eAs\nI explained earlier, MetLife relied upon Ms Hellessey’s Facebook posts,\nher activities involving horse shows and clubs, and\nin particular her\ninvolvement with Fairymead, as the foundation of an argument that Ms\nHellessey’s activities over the period\nsince the assessment date are\ninconsistent with her having the symptoms that she claims to have.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"999\"\u003eI\nanalysed the principal evidence concerning Ms Hellessey’s Facebook posts\nat pars 731 to 767 above.

In my view, even though ultimately a\nsignificantly greater number\nof Facebook posts were relied upon by MetLife than\nwere the subject of Dr Durrell’s report, they only covered a much longer\nperiod and did not demonstrate activities by Ms Hellessey that were different in\nquality or significance to those that were considered\nby Dr Durrell. He said:\n“I can confirm that these contacts on Facebook do not represent real-life\nfriendships and in the main\nthese are persons loosely and indirectly associated\nwith Ms Hellessey through her lifelong interest in horse breeding and horse\nshowing”.\nSee also the observation by Dr Hodgson in her 3 May 2013 report\n(par 231 above):\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e","\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1001\"\u003eI\nalso refer to Mr Rawling’s opinion in his 8 August 2016 report, set out at\npar 698 above, in which Mr Rawling explained that\nobservations gleaned during\nthe course of covert intelligence and from reviewing Facebook postings are not\nclear-cut in cases of\npsychological injury, because they tell little of the true\npsychological state at the time.

Social phobia is only one of the symptoms of Ms Hellessey’s\npsychological injury that is supported by the medical evidence. Facebook\nmessages that are posted by a person suffering from social\nphobia that have been\ncomposed on the person’s computer at home do not necessarily have the same\nsignificance as would identical\nstatements made spontaneously in person to other\npersons in a real social context.

Assumptions of cause and effect that are consistent with normal\npsychological\nhealth may not apply to persons with psychological injuries. Not\nonly is there a heightened risk that false conclusions will be reached,\nbut the\nperson with normal psychological health has no objective means of judging when\nand to what degree that person has made an\nerror when the person draws\nconclusions based upon the Facebook posts that assume that the maker of the\nposts is acting in the same\nway as a person of good psychological health.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1004\"\u003eThe\ncourt is in the same position as persons who enjoy good psychological health\ngenerally, which is why the court should be particularly\ncareful to have regard\nto experienced medical opinion concerning the significance of the\npsychologically injured person’s communications.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1005\"\u003eIn\nthe present case, Ms Hellessey’s treating psychiatrist, Dr Durrell was\naware of Ms Hellessey’s use of Facebook and\nconsidered it to be\n“therapeutic” (par 670).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1006\"\u003eFurther,\nit follows from the analysis of the Facebook posts that I have undertaken above\nthat Ms Hellessey did not in numerical terms\nmake a substantial number of posts.\nThe posts were substantially concerned with Ms Hellessey’s involvement in\nhorse-related\nactivities. Those activities were in general terms known to and\nrecommended by Ms Hellessey’s treating psychiatrist and psychologist\n(especially pars 194, 202 and 217 above). Dr Durrell reported in his 29\nSeptember 2013 report his understanding that Ms Hellessey\nhad been unable to\nride, show or lead horses in shows due to her hypersensitivity of being observed\nby others, and that without the\nsupport persons and the anxiolytic medication it\nwas most unlikely that Ms Hellessey would be able to continue with her\n‘behind\nthe scenes’ at the Royal Easter Shows and other shows (par\n202).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1007\"\u003eI\nfind that the evidence of Ms Hellessey, Ms Eves, Ms Cleary and Mr Harvey that I\nhave considered above establishes that Ms Hellessey’s\ninvolvement with\nhorse shows and other horse-related activities was not inconsistent with her\nsuffering from social phobia (see pars\n541, 630, 639 and 655 above). Once it is\naccepted that even serious cases of PTSD and depression may not prevent the\nsufferer getting\nout of bed every day or cause the sufferer to lead a\nhermit-like existence, the evidence of Ms Hellessey’s limited and\nrestricted\npersonal involvement in horse shows is not inconsistent with the\nsymptoms of her psychological injury that she and her treating medical\nprofessionals have identified. In fact, if the evidence is considered in a\nbalanced way, it is consistent with a very limited social\nexistence, and\ninconsistent with the capacity for Ms Hellessey to successfully engage in the\njobs identified in the vocational assessment\nreport.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1008\"\u003eI\nalso find that the evidence concerning Ms Hellessey’s limited involvement\nwith the Palomino Association and the Goulburn Pony\nClub does not prove that Ms\nHellessey has not suffered from the social phobia that her psychiatrist and\npsychologist identified.\nThese activities by Ms Hellessey involved occasional\nmeetings over a relatively short period of time with small numbers of people\nwith whom Ms Hellessey was familiar, and also involved limited and rudimentary\nactivities and communications by Ms Hellessey with\noutsiders. The significance\nof these activities must be weighed giving due proportion to the evidence given\nby Ms Hellessey’s\nlay witnesses, which I have accepted, concerning all of\nthe symptoms of her psychological injury. Those symptoms are not limited\nto\nsocial phobia, but include many additional symptoms, such as detachment,\nemotional numbing, hyperarousal including insomnia, irritability,\npoor\nconcentration and hypervigilance (par 183 above).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1009\"\u003eI\nalso find that Ms Hellessey’s involvement with Fairymead does not have the\nsignificance that MetLife attributed to it. It\ndid not concern a business of any\nsignificance. It was a name used by Ms Cleary and Ms Hellessey for a number of\nrelatively limited\npurposes. To the extent that the name was used in connection\nwith any activity that could reasonably be considered to be a business,\nthe\nbusiness was conducted by Ms Cleary. It was Ms Cleary who owned a stallion that\nwas on occasions the subject of advertisements\nusing the name\n“Fairymead” in relation to offers that the stallion would service\nmares. There is no evidence that Ms\nHellessey ever earned any money through her\ninvolvement with Fairymead. Ms Hellessey always acknowledged her involvement in\nhorse-related\nactivities. As I have noted above, in the documents that she\nsubmitted with her application for the TPD benefits she acknowledged\na special\ninterest in “horse breeding – showing”, and in relation to\nbelonging to any clubs or organisations she\nsaid: “horse associations\n\u0026amp; clubs”. Although this information was brief, it was fitting in\nrelation to the amount\nof space allowed for the responses on the form. The\nevidence shows that Ms Hellessey and Ms Cleary used the name\n“Fairymead”\nin relation to their show horses, and in relation to\nsuch minor matters as giving small donations to clubs to fund prizes for Ms\nHellessey’s children and other club members. It is likely that Ms\nHellessey and Ms Cleary made the activities of Fairymead\nappear more substantial\nthan they were.

Indeed, MetLife only called expert\nevidence from the psychologist, Professor Mattick.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1030\"\u003eThere\nis no adequate basis in the evidence for concluding that Ms Hellessey will\nspontaneously recover from her psychological injury,\nand there is no reason to\nconclude that any form of medication will have that result.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1031\"\u003eIf,\nas the evidence establishes, Ms Hellessey will be prescribed medication\ngenerally of the nature of her present prescriptions into\nthe indefinite future,\nthen the question whether Ms Hellessey is unlikely ever to gain employment in a\nrelevant occupation must be\nconsidered by taking into account the likely\nconsequences of Ms Hellessey being continually medicated. In this regard it is\nimportant\nto remember that the unchallenged evidence is that Ms Hellessey is\nrequired to take anxiolytics, principally Valium, on an as needs\nbasis, to ward\noff impending anxiety and panic attacks (see the evidence of Dr Durrell\ndiscussed at par 197 above). As I have mentioned,\nMs Hellessey’s evidence\nwas that she had taken her medication, including Valium, on the day of her\ncross-examination.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1032\"\u003eThe\nvocational assessment report upon which MetLife relied to reject Ms\nHellessey’s claim is considered above at pars 223 to\n225. The job options\nidentified for Ms Hellessey were learning and development officer/training and\ndevelopment professional, childcare\nworker, driving instructor, cashier, and\nsales representative.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1033\"\u003eWhile\nthat report has been received into evidence, I would place little weight on it,\nin the absence of Mr Everett having been called\nfor the purpose of supporting\nhis report and being available for cross examination. Dr Durrell in his 16\nFebruary 2013 report (par\n189 above) and Dr Westmore in his 9 December 2015\nreport (par 380 above) directly challenged the validity of the conclusions\nreached\nby Mr Everett. On the face of the report, Mr Everett ruled out jobs that\nhad aspects in common with being a member of the police\nforce, or required the\nuse of firearms. However, Mr Everett gave no indication that he took into\naccount the real consequences of\nthe actual symptoms from which the evidence\nshows Ms Hellessey suffers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1034\"\u003eFurthermore,\nMetLife did not conduct the cross examination of Ms Hellessey as if its case was\nthat she was, or would in the future\nbe, capable of undertaking one of the five\nforms of employment identified by Mr Everett. MetLife’s counsel\ncross-examined Ms\nHellessey in the manner I have described above (see in\nparticular par 551) as to whether she was capable of engaging in various types\nof horse-related activity. That was not a case advanced by MetLife before the\ncommencement of the hearing, and Ms Hellessey was not\ngiven any adequate notice\nof it. I am satisfied by Ms Hellessey’s responses in cross-examination\nthat MetLife has not established\nthat Ms Hellessey is, or will in the future be,\ncapable of obtaining the horse-related employment suggested by MetLife\nnotwithstanding\nthe continuing effects of her symptoms caused by PTSD and\ndepression.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1035\"\u003eI\nhave also set out above at par 606 my observation of Ms Hellessey in the witness\nbox. I was satisfied that Ms Hellessey appeared\nto be affected by her\nmedication, although the effect was subtle. As I put it, she appeared to be\nsubdued and at least mildly depressed.\nHer attention was shallow and her\nresponses were somewhat mechanical. I have no means of knowing whether Ms\nHellessey has this affect\nat times when, in addition to her other medication,\nshe feels the need to take Valium to counteract anxiety and panic attacks.\nHowever,\nin my view it is reasonable on the evidence to conclude that at least\nintermittently when Ms Hellessey is presented with triggers\nfor her anxiety and\npanic, her medication will have an effect on her appearance and behaviour that\nis material to her prospects of\ngaining and retaining employment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1036\"\u003eIt\nwill be reasonable to consider Ms Hellessey’s employment prospects taking\ninto account that she will owe an obligation to\nprospective employers to advise\nthem that she continues to suffer from PTSD and depression for which she takes\nmedication, including\nValium to ward off anxiety and panic. It is most unlikely\nthat knowledge of those matters will commend itself to potential employers\nof Ms\nHellessey as a childcare worker or driving instructor, and the position may well\nbe little different with the other job options\nidentified.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1037\"\u003eEven\nputting aside the potential consequences of Ms Hellessey’s continuing\nmedication regime, the likelihood of her ever gaining\nrelevant employment must\nbe considered having regard to the evidence of the symptoms from which she\nsuffers. Ms Hellessey’s\nevidence of those symptoms is set out at par 544\nabove. Mr Hellessey’s evidence in par 13 of his affidavit may be found at\npar 611. The equivalent evidence of Ms Eves, Ms Hellessey’s mother, is set\nout at par 628. Although that evidence will be influenced\nby the individual\nperceptions and perspectives of the witnesses, I broadly accept it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"1038\"\u003eThe\nevidence was consistent with the description of the symptoms of PTSD and\ndepression given by Dr Durrell (pars 183, 186, 187 and\n189 above), Dr\nHodgson’s evidence (par 229), and Dr Westmore’s evidence (par 380).\nIt is also consistent with my description\nof the symptoms in \u003ci\u003eWheeler\u003c/i\u003e\n(above) at [48]. Although all of the descriptions differ in various respects,\nthey are substantially consistent.

The\nfirst proceeded on\nthe basis that the wording “ensure that the price paid\nfor the Rights is as commercially advantageous as possible having regard\nto the\ncurrent market situation” imposed upon V8 Holdings an obligation\ntantamount to a guarantee that the price ultimately\nachieved would in fact be as\ncommercially advantageous as possible having regard to the current market\nsituation.

(In putting these two possibilities, as V8\nHoldings did in its submissions, I have not ignored V8\nHoldings’ argument\nthat, as a matter of strict logic, the first proposition could not stand alone\ndivorced from the practical\nneed to determine the most commercially advantageous\nprice as a result of the tender process).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"51\"\u003eUltimately,\nas I understand Sanpoint’s final written submissions, V8 Holdings’\napprehension that Sanpoint contended that\ncl 10.1(b) had the absolute effect of\nthe first of the alternatives set out above was misplaced, as in the\nintroduction Sanpoint\nput its case in the following way:\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e","\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"52\"\u003eThat\nsubmission is consistent with the second of the alternatives stated by V8\nHoldings.

Sanpoint accepted that the inter-relationship\nbetween that obligation and the part of the provision which said “by\noffering the contract to the market by tender” was at the heart of the\ncase (par 6). Sanpoint concluded by saying:\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e","\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"53\"\u003eThat\nsubmission appears to accept that the parts of cl 10.1(b) that are joined by the\nword “by” create a composite obligation\nwhereby V8 Holdings must put\nthe REC to the market by tender in a manner calculated to ensure that the price\noffered is as commercially\nadvantageous as possible having regard to the current\nmarket situation, and if it does that, whatever price is in fact offered by\nthe\nhighest bidder will be the price that satisfies V8 Holdings’ obligation to\nachieve the result contemplated by the clause.\nIn that way the focus of what\nmust be ensured is the process rather than the outcome.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"54\"\u003eIn\nmy view that is the correct way to construe cl 10.1(b).

The implied term the subject of the\ndeclaration in par 1 of the\nclaim for relief, in using the words “required to offer...to the market by\ntender in such a manner\nas to achieve...” is consistent with the way\nSanpoint put its case in final submissions (although it no longer propounded the\nimplied term). The list of shortcomings in the tender process in the declaration\nin prayer 2 of the claim for relief is consistent\nwith the obligation to ensure\nonly relating to the manner in which the tender was implemented. The same is\ntrue for Sanpoint’s\nallegation of breach of cl 10.1(b) in par 23 of the\ncross claim, save for the addition of sub-par 23(h), which I will consider\nseparately\nbelow.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"57\"\u003eThe\nparties are in dispute as to what the use of the words “current market\nsituation” in cl 10.1(b) concurrently with\nthe requirement that V8\nHoldings was to “ensure” a specified result of the tender process\nrequired V8 Holdings to do\nin relation to the information that was provided to\nbidders. Without elaboration on their part, the parties appear to have accepted\nthat the use of the expression “current market situation” directed\nattention to the economic reality that the fixing\nof prices by markets depends\nupon the information that is available to competing bidders. If the agent of the\nseller has an obligation\nto ensure that the price offered by the highest bidder\nin the tender process is as advantageous to the seller as possible, the agent\nmust disclose to competing bidders the information material to an assessment by\nthe bidders of the value of the rights on offer that\nwill induce the bidders to\noffer the highest prices possible.

It was Sanpoint’s case\nthat the obligation upon V8 Holdings to ensure the achievement of\nthe most\ncommercially advantageous price possible through the tender process required V8\nHoldings in substance to provide all of\nthe evolving information to bidders, and\nto do so on a continuing basis. Sanpoint went so far as to submit that, if it\nbecame practically\ndifficult for V8 Holdings to paraphrase the available\ninformation, as that information was substantially embodied in emails that\nwere\nexchanged between relevant persons, V8 Holdings could have, and should have,\nsimply made all of the emails available to potential\nbidders.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"59\"\u003eThe\npractical effect of the obligation to “ensure” was to require V8\nHoldings to act in Sanpoint’s interests, rather\nthan its own, or the\ninterests of Archer or the remaining Teams. It is also implicit in\nSanpoint’s case that the obligation\non V8 Holdings to “ensure”\nthat bidders had all of the information that was likely to induce them to offer\nthe most advantageous\nprice obliged V8 Holdings to make that information\navailable in a manner that was not circumscribed by any self-interested\nobjective\nof V8 Holdings to minimise any litigation risk to itself at the suit\nof bidders by reason of possibly misleading overstatements as\nto the underlying\nvalue of the REC.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"60\"\u003eIn\nessence, although Sanpoint did not expound the argument, Sanpoint contended that\nthe obligation upon V8 Holdings in cl 10.1(b)\nto ensure a particular result by\nthe manner in which it conducted the tender “having regard to the current\nmarket situation”\nhad to recognise that the word “current”\napplied to the whole of the period of the tender leading up to its close, so\nthat if the available information evolved in a way that was likely to encourage\ncompeting bidders to offer higher prices, then V8\nHoldings was required to\nprogressively provide that information to bidders. Furthermore, the obligation\nto “ensure” that\nthe highest bid would be as advantageous as\npossible given the evolving information required V8 Holdings to provide the\ninformation\nfully and not to restrict the information in any way in order to\nachieve the interests of itself or any other parties than Sanpoint.\nSanpoint did\nnot, of course, go so far as to submit that the REC required V8 Holdings to\nconduct the tender in a manner that was\nmisleading and deceptive, or was likely\nto mislead and deceive bidders, or was in any other manner unlawful. However, it\ndid submit\nthat the obligation to “ensure” required V8 Holdings to\ngo to the fullest extent that fell short of a real risk of unlawful\nbehaviour.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"61\"\u003eAs\nwill be seen, V8 Holdings’ position was that the obligation imposed upon\nit by cl 10.1(b) was much more static and constrained.\nV8 Holdings considered\nthat it was sufficient for it to make a single notification of the possibility\nof an event occurring that\nwould tend to increase the price that competing\nbidders might offer for the REC, and to do so in a neutrally worded and\nconventional\nmanner that would minimise the risk of misleading or deceiving\nbidders.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"62\"\u003eIt\nwill be convenient to defer further consideration of the position adopted by V8\nHoldings, and the resolution of the contest between\nthe parties, until after the\nrelevant facts have been determined.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"63\"\u003eAs\nI have observed, at the end of the tender process no bids had been made for\nSanpoint’s REC.

Rather, by the process initiated by Mr Dane, who was one\nof the representatives for the remaining Teams on the board,\nV8 Holdings acted\nin the interests of the remaining Teams for the purpose of preserving V8\nSupercars racing, and in this sense they\nhad a conflict of interest.

Mr Dane added:\n“Everyone has signed the REC on the basis that the Board has absolute\ndiscretion”. As that was Mr Dane’s response to the suggestion by Mr\nHogarth that there was an obligation to optimise\nthe price, there is a fair\ninference that the message Mr Dane sought to convey was that the discretion of\nthe board was paramount.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"157\"\u003eMr\nHogarth raised the question of what would happen if there were no bids or if a\n“low ball” number was received. Existing\nTeams may not want to know\nwhat the current “market” value of their RECs was. Mr Dane observed:\n“If no bids are\nreceived then we would have to shelve them to try again\nnext year. We have a responsibility to the business and the shareholders\nnow to\ntry to put cars on the grid for 2015.

Mr\nDane’s stated justification\nwas that all Teams knew that their RECs were\nof little value anyway. Mr Dane’s response appears to suggest that V8\nHoldings\nshould look after the remaining Teams, rather than those that had\nsurrendered their RECs, because the tender process would not yield\nhigh prices\nfor those rights in any event.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"159\"\u003eMr\nHogarth also raised the question of what would happen if all three of the RECs\nwere purchased in the tender, given that Archer’s\nmodel was based on 26\nRECs. This statement appears to reflect some preliminary indication made by\nArcher, which is not otherwise\nestablished by the evidence, that any restructure\nshould be on the basis that there were 26 cars in the field. There is some\nevidence\nthat 26 cars was the minimum that V8 Holdings’ agreement with\nbroadcasters required. It is not clear whether the 26 car number\nwas selected\nafter Archer became aware that three RECs had been surrendered. It is not clear\nwhether Archer was wedded to the number\n26, and not more. Mr Dane commented:\n“It is up to the Board to decide whether to match any tender offers and\nbuy back. So the\nBoard can make this determination in due course”.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"160\"\u003eMr\nHogarth said: “Given the illiquidity of any REC market, is 21 days the\nright period of time for the tender?” Mr Dane’s\nresponse was:\n“Anyone who is potentially in the market will know about the availability\nand will be able to act in my opinion.\nThis will flush people out”. This\nevidence establishes that V8 Holdings was aware that the market for RECs was\nilliquid. Mr\nHogarth at least was aware that a 21 day period may not maximise\nthe chances of one or more of the RECs being sold. Mr Dane repeated\nhis\nassertion that potential purchasers would be able to act quickly. Even though\nthere is some probability that potential purchasers\nwould be well acquainted\nwith V8 Supercars racing, it does not follow that they could put together an\neffective racing business model\nin 21 days. Mr Dane had already indicated his\npreference for the interests of the business and the remaining Teams.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"161\"\u003eMr\nHogarth suggested alternatives to running a tender, in view of the probability\nthat “there will likely be a large process\nof winding up the current REC\nformat and the constitutions and shareholder agreements for V8HPL”. V8\nHoldings could negotiate\na buyback price with the three surrendering RECs.\nCurrent REC holders and Archer could agree on a price “as part of the\nbroader\nrestructure resolutions”. V8 Holdings could buy back the\nsurrendered RECs and account to the surrendering REC holders for the\nnet\nproceeds.

It\nadded that there was an extraordinary lack of information about the\npotential\ncorporate restructure that was put in the tender documents.

As it\nhappened, there\nwere no compliant third-party bids for Sanpoint’s REC, or\neither of the other two surrendered RECs. The board of V8 Holdings\nwas not\nrequired to deal with the problem of bidders offering different prices, or there\nbeing fewer bidders than RECs on sale. However,\nit is significant that from this\npoint V8 Holdings gave consideration to how it would deal with these problems.\nThat is a matter\nthat may be relevant to the determination of whether Sanpoint\nhas demonstrated that it suffered a loss as a result of any breach\nof the REC by\nV8 Holdings, and if so, the quantification of that loss.

Why would a potential\nbidder\noffer a substantial price for the right to a REC with knowledge that\ncircumstances beyond the bidder’s control might deny the\nbidder the\nenjoyment of the REC, and where the entitlement to receive compensation was\nunpredictable?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"405\"\u003eThe\ninformation in the data room concerning the estimated gross cash distributions\nfor 2014 (see par 221 above) would not have encouraged\nbidders, as it was\nplainly at a level that had historically been insufficient to permit many of the\nTeams to avoid suffering very\nsubstantial annual operating losses.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"406\"\u003eIn\nmy opinion, far from the available information concerning the likelihood of a\nrestructure agreement encouraging potential bidders\nto bid to acquire a REC, on\nbalance that information was likely to depress the enthusiasm of potential\nbidders to bid a substantial\nprice for a REC.

Of course, as no conforming bids were made,\nthese mathematical\nconsiderations remain theoretical. As a practical matter, the\ncourt can do little more than to act on the basis that the evidence\nwould need\nto be particularly persuasive that the tender proceeds would have yielded bids\nabove $20,000 if the alleged breaches had\nnot occurred before the court could be\nsatisfied on the balance of probabilities that a bid would have been made for\nSanpoint’s\nREC.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"414\"\u003eThe\ndifficulties that arise from the fact that three RECs were on offer, and\nsubstantial prices may not have been bid in respect of\nall of them, is not\ndecisive against the possibility that Sanpoint suffered a loss on the balance of\nprobabilities.

Under his will, the\ndeceased gave Ante a conditional\nlifetime right of occupation of that property.\nIt is self-evident that the fee simple ownership of the property is greatly more\nvaluable\nthan a conditional non-exclusive right of occupancy. The court must\ninfer from the limited and contingent nature of the gift made\nby the deceased in\nrelation to the property that the deceased had positively determined not to give\nAnte the fee simple title to\nthe property. Ante’s argument that the order\nhe seeks is consistent with the intent of the deceased is logically inconsistent\nwith the basis upon which Ante has asked the court to set aside the gift\nactually made in his favour, which is that the deceased\ndetermined to make that\ngift on the basis of a false premise as to Ante’s capacity to receive and\nhold the property in his\nown name.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"298\"\u003eI\nalso do not accept Ante’s submission that, in this case, the fact that\nAnte has lived at 1 Harry Avenue all his life, and\nthat he has expressed a deep\nemotional attachment to that property as the family home, is a significant\njustification for making\na family provision order that would give Ante the\nentire benefit of that property to the exclusion of his sisters. It is a truism\nthat each family provision claim must be dealt with on its own facts, and that\nthe manner in which other claims have been decided\nrarely provides genuine\nguidance as to how the application before the court should be decided. In my\nview the decisions of the Court\nof Appeal in \u003ci\u003eAlexander v Jansson\u003c/i\u003e and\n\u003ci\u003eChan v Chan\u003c/i\u003e referred to above are plainly distinguishable on their facts,\nand nothing will be gained from a minute comparison between the facts\nin this\ncase and those cases. I do not ignore the facts that 1 Harry Avenue has been\nAnte’s lifelong home, that he has a real\ndesire to continue to live there,\nand that it is the centre of his social existence. That would be a significant\nfactor if the value\nof the deceased’s estate was sufficient to enable the\ncourt to make a family provision order giving Ante the property, and\nalso to\nmake adequate provision for the proper maintenance of Ante’s sisters.\nUnfortunately, the estate is not large enough\nto justify that approach.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"299\"\u003eI\nrepeat the findings that I made when considering the evidence led by Ante.

The\ndeceased\nwas the best judge of those matters, and he decided that he had an obligation to\nprovide Ante with accommodation for the\nrest of his life, albeit on a contingent\nand limited basis, and also albeit upon a premise concerning Ante’s\ncapacities that\nall of his children now accept was unwarranted.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"303\"\u003eAs\nthe deceased accepted that he ought to make the provision that he did in favour\nof Ante in his will, and as the sisters do not\nchallenge Ante’s right to\nbe awarded a family provision order of a lump sum in an amount up to $900,000,\nthere is no reason\nfor the court to consider whether or not Ante engaged in any\ndisentitling conduct, so there is no need for the court to resolve with\nany\nprecision the disputes about the level of assistance provided by Ante to his\nparents, or the extent to which Ante behaved inappropriately\ntowards his\nparents.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"304\"\u003eThe\nevidence establishes that the deceased gave Ante a loan of $80,000 to assist him\nto buy 11 Harry Avenue, although it also establishes\nthat the amount of the loan\nwas repaid at the time 11 Harry Avenue was sold.

The conveyancing records that were in evidence show that the purchase\nprice was $154,000 and that Ante\nsold the property in 1999 for a price of\n$245,000. Ante also stated that he repaid the mortgage during the time that he\nowed the\nproperty. The amount of that repayment would have been $74,000. Ante\nwould have been assisted in being able to repay the mortgage\nby using the net\nrent from the property. The repayment required was about $1000 per month. The\nhistorical title search for the property\nshows that the property was mortgaged\non 23 November 1993 on the date it was transferred to Ante. There was a\ndischarge of mortgage\nand a new mortgage registered on 17 August 1998. Ante did\nnot give evidence of the circumstances leading to this new mortgage. The\nevidence establishes that on 28 June 1999, Ante’s parents lodged a caveat\nto protect their right to receive repayment of the\n$80,000.

Under his will, the\ndeceased gave Ante a conditional\nlifetime right of occupation of that property.\nIt is self-evident that the fee simple ownership of the property is greatly more\nvaluable\nthan a conditional non-exclusive right of occupancy. The court must\ninfer from the limited and contingent nature of the gift made\nby the deceased in\nrelation to the property that the deceased had positively determined not to give\nAnte the fee simple title to\nthe property.

It is a truism\nthat each family provision claim must be dealt with on its own facts, and that\nthe manner in which other claims have been decided\nrarely provides genuine\nguidance as to how the application before the court should be decided. In my\nview the decisions of the Court\nof Appeal in \u003ci\u003eAlexander v Jansson\u003c/i\u003e and\n\u003ci\u003eChan v Chan\u003c/i\u003e referred to above are plainly distinguishable on their facts,\nand nothing will be gained from a minute comparison between the facts\nin this\ncase and those cases. I do not ignore the facts that 1 Harry Avenue has been\nAnte’s lifelong home, that he has a real\ndesire to continue to live there,\nand that it is the centre of his social existence. That would be a significant\nfactor if the value\nof the deceased’s estate was sufficient to enable the\ncourt to make a family provision order giving Ante the property, and\nalso to\nmake adequate provision for the proper maintenance of Ante’s sisters.\nUnfortunately, the estate is not large enough\nto justify that approach.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"299\"\u003eI\nrepeat the findings that I made when considering the evidence led by Ante.

The\ndeceased\nwas the best judge of those matters, and he decided that he had an obligation to\nprovide Ante with accommodation for the\nrest of his life, albeit on a contingent\nand limited basis, and also albeit upon a premise concerning Ante’s\ncapacities that\nall of his children now accept was unwarranted.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"303\"\u003eAs\nthe deceased accepted that he ought to make the provision that he did in favour\nof Ante in his will, and as the sisters do not\nchallenge Ante’s right to\nbe awarded a family provision order of a lump sum in an amount up to $900,000,\nthere is no reason\nfor the court to consider whether or not Ante engaged in any\ndisentitling conduct, so there is no need for the court to resolve with\nany\nprecision the disputes about the level of assistance provided by Ante to his\nparents, or the extent to which Ante behaved inappropriately\ntowards his\nparents.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"304\"\u003eThe\nevidence establishes that the deceased gave Ante a loan of $80,000 to assist him\nto buy 11 Harry Avenue, although it also establishes\nthat the amount of the loan\nwas repaid at the time 11 Harry Avenue was sold.

Each of the sisters, over the\nbalance of the deceased’s life, maintained a proper relationship with the\ndeceased,\nthough in each case, and in the case of Dina for a relatively long\nperiod, the relationship was soured because of conduct and attitudes\nadopted by\nthe deceased towards his daughters that prevented them enjoying consistent and\nregular contact with him.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"325\"\u003eWhile\nI recognise that the nature of Ante’s relationship with the deceased was\nsignificantly different from that enjoyed by\nthe sisters, I do not consider that\nthat circumstance in itself entitles Ante to a substantially more generous\nprovision out of the\ndeceased’s estate than that to which the sisters are\nentitled.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"326\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sa2006138/s60.html\" class=\"autolink_findacts\"\u003eSection\n60(2)(b)\u003c/a\u003e of the Act invites the court to have regard to the nature and extent of\nany obligations or responsibilities owed by the deceased\nto the applicant for a\nfamily provision order.

If it were, that would suggest that a\nsimilar offence was somewhat mitigated because of perceived wrongdoing by the\nowner of the property. The particular significance of the present owners being\nblameless victims is the financial loss they have\nsustained.

Gino\nalso said that he recognised that damaging\npeople’s property would psychologically affect them and cause harm.\nNothing was\nsaid about how killing people might affect those close to them nor\nhow police officers might be affected by believing, quite reasonably,\nthat they\nwere being shot at by a high-powered rifle while trying to apprehend the\noffenders.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"113\"\u003eThere\nwas some evidence that the offenders had offered to apply their assets,\nprincipally a property settlement from Gino’s\nwife worth about $48,000,\ntowards the victims of the arson.

There is little evidence of what forensic investigations\nhad\nbeen done and, in the light of the early confession of the murder, not much\nforensic work may have been carried out.

It is only when one reads what Mark said to Dr Adams\nabout 12 months later\nthat there is any suggestion that it was done out of any\nsense of fear for what the deceased or his partners might do to the offenders.\nWhen the offenders were not prepared to give evidence and subject themselves to\ncross-examination at the sentence hearing, I cannot\nplace any store on the\njustification provided to Dr Adams to the extent that it differs from what was\nsaid immediately after the\noffenders were arrested in the two separate\ninterviews of Mark Stocco.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"116\"\u003eMr\nCimone’s involvement in any cannabis-growing enterprise or his perceived\nbad treatment of the offenders, if either was the\ncase, is beside the point.

Further, the\nreference to “failure” was\nnot a reference to an inherent defect in\nthe rope but to its traumatic failure under pressure; a tensile failure caused\nby the tension\nplaced on the steel wire rope being more than it was able to bear\n(Transcript, 21 April 2015, at 433.10-433.19). Further the auxiliary\nrope\nexplosively failed or snapped when 28 tonnes of working load was applied to it,\nin circumstances where the safe working load\nwas somewhere between 5 and 6\ntonnes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"241\"\u003eIt\nis not absolutely clear, from the evidence of the experts, that the auxiliary\ncable has a safety mechanism when ordinarily utilised\nor during the erection of\nthe pile driver.

The\nevidence of the joint experts makes clear that when the 28 tonnes of load was\nplaced on the auxiliary cable,\nit snapped. The explosive failure occasioned by\nthe tension (and to some extent the elasticity in the mast itself) caused the\ntackle\nand chain to be “flung”. The degree to which it was flung\ndepended upon a range of factors, which were unknown to the\nexperts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"245\"\u003eFurther,\nit is clear from the evidence of each of the experts that, had the initial pull\nout or allowance for the cable on the auxiliary\nhoist been adequate in terms of\nenough rope or cable, this tensile failure would not have occurred and if there\nhad been someone\nconstantly watching the tension on the auxiliary cable, even if\nthe initial allowance for the cable had not been adequate, this accident\nwould\nnot have occurred. At Transcript, 21 April 2015 at 469.13, after\nMr O’Dowd asked “would you agree with that?”,\nMr O’Brien nodded in agreement. The witness also agreed that those\ncircumstances rendered it more important, rather than less\nimportant, that the\noperators pay very close attention to those two matters: one, the length of the\ninitial cable; and/or two, the\nvigilance of the offsider who was observing the\ntension on the rope as the rig was being hoisted.

Instead, albeit\nslowly, the two operators continued with the erection process until the\nauxiliary cable explosively failed. At the time their attention was on the main\ncable.

The difficulty (identified by the\noriginal\nsubjection) is the impact of the brain injury on motivation and\ninitiative.

Because\nthe allowance\nis made for visits to the general practitioner solely for the\npurpose of treating matters arising from the injury, which is the subject\nof\ncompensation, it is unnecessary to allow for vicissitudes. There will be other\nvisits to the general practitioners for non-compensable\nreasons.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"368\"\u003eI\ndeal then with the nerve stimulator.

The occupational therapist,\nMs Kennedy-Gould, estimated\nthat an initial period of four hours per day of past gratuitous care was\nappropriate until 10 April 2007\nand thereafter and into the future the claim is\nfor three hours care per day. The care arises from a combination of a\npsychological\nand physical restrictions (see Ms Kennedy-Gould’s first\nreport, Exhibit F1, p 467-468 and her second report at Exhibit F1,\np 484-485).\nDr Jungfer concurred in those opinions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"372\"\u003eThe\nevidence of Ms Kennedy-Gould is not contested. The evidence of the\npsychiatrists in relation to their concurrence with those estimates\nin the\nreports of Ms Kennedy-Gould were not the subject of cross-examination.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"373\"\u003eThe\nsummary of the evidence earlier provided indicates that the plaintiff was active\ninside the house in cooking and other household\nchores before the accident and\nwas not in any way active after the accident. As a consequence, I allow past\ngratuitous domestic and\nattendant care at 28 hours per week until 10 April 2007\nat the rate of $22.50 per hour; at 21 hours per week from then until 13 April\n2015 at the rate of $25.46 per hour; then at 21 hours per week until 1 April\n2017 at the rate of $45.50 per hour and thereafter during\nthe life expectancy at\nthe continuing allowance of 21 hours per week at the rate of $45.50 per hour. I\nalso allow lawn mowing and\ngardening on average at 1 hour per week at the rate\nof $45 per hour during the life expectancy and, likewise, handyman assistance\non\naverage 24 hours per annum or 0.46 hours per week at the rate of $70 per hour\nfor the whole of the life expectancy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"\" value=\"374\"\u003eThe\nlast matter with which I deal is the issue of non-economic loss.

The Amount of the limit on damages is reserved for a most\nextreme case.
